The idea is that when reporting an animal, the user will start filling out a form
about the animal's situation and location.
If people want to leave their contact information in the last stage, this should
give them the possibility to stay connected with the NGOs and get information
about the condition of the animal.
When submitting the form, the form should be sent to the nearest NGO station.

To participate in the Hackathon, it was a requirement to implement Clerk
Authantication, but it was finally removed because no authantication should be
necessary to use the app, to make sure to help the animal as fast as possible.
